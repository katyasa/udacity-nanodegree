## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
You will need the standard data science libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit learn to run the  project. For some visualisation, installing plotly will be necessary. 

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, I analysed data from AirBnB holiday rentals in Edinburgh with the view of addressing the following questions:

1. What are the determinants of price? 
2. What neighbourhoods (if any) are strong predictors of price?
3. What amenities (if any) are strong predictors of price? 
4. Is there any seasonality of holiday rental prices?

## Data<a name="data"></a>
The data analysed here was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html I used the following two files for Edinburgh:
- `listings.csv` - detailed Listings data for Edinburgh compiled in February 2021
- `calendar.csv` - detailed Calendar Data for listings in Edinburgh compiled in February 2021


## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
The repository contains the following files:

* `1_listings.ipybn` - Jupyter notebook of the analysis of the calendar data
* `2_calendar.ipybn` - Jupyter notebook of the analysis of the listings data following the CRISP-DM process
* Images - folder with images
